# Family Feud
In my senior year of high school, one of my clubs hosted a "Game Show Night" fundraiser event.
I decided to create a quick website for our version of Family Feud.
We were able to successfully play four rounds of the game using this site.

## Implementation
The code was written in Svelte, which is a JavaScript framework.
The questions/answers were stored in a JSON file.

Live site (may get "Dangerous Site" warning): [family-feud-hosa.vercel.app](https://family-feud-hosa.vercel.app/?q=1).

Code: [github.com/yang-taylor/family-feud](https://github.com/yang-taylor/family-feud)

## Constraints
- The answer bank is static and cannot be edited on the fly.
- The questions are housed on a separate text document, to prevent from the screen.
- The only people who can play this version of the game are people with access to the quesiton bank and the answer key.
